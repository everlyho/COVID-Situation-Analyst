Significant statistics and trends for COVID 19, focuses on the COVID-19 trends globally throughout 2020 for the top three most affected
countries, India, United States of America, and Brazil, as well as the relationship between high COVID-19 rates and population. 
The dataset that I used is from the CORGIS Dataset Project created in November 2020 and includes daily reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths in 
countries worldwide. The data also shows the countryâ€™s population as well as the number of cases per 100,000 people on a rolling 14-day average.
Using this dataset, I wanted to explore the extent of COVID-19 impact on countries and gain some insight on what conclusions I can likely draw 
from the correlation between COVID-19 and how populated a country is through our visualizations.
